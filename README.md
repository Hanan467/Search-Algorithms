# Search Algorithms in Python

This project implements and compares popular **search algorithms** in **Python**, including **BFS, DFS, UCS**, and **Simulated Annealing**. It’s designed for exploring search strategies across various problem spaces.

## Algorithms Included

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Explores all nodes level by level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Dives deep into each path before backtracking.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** – Expands the least-cost path first.
- **Simulated Annealing** – Probabilistic optimization inspired by thermodynamics.

## Installation

 Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hanan467/Search-Algorithms.git
   cd Search-Algorithms
